# ⚙️ Installation Guide

## 1️⃣ Install Python 3.11

Download from:  
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Ensure Python is added to PATH.

---

## 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

### Windows
```bash
py -3.11 -m venv venv
macOS/Linux
python3.11 -m venv venv
3️⃣ Activate Environment
Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
4️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Running the Application
python app.py
Open browser:

http://localhost:5000
🔐 Optional API Configuration
Create .env file in root directory:

NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
GOOGLE_FACT_CHECK_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
MEDIA_STACK_API_KEY=your_mediastack_key
Without API keys, ML + Sentiment detection will still work.
